I'm a Data Scientist who enjoys creating solutions to contemporary problems. I've worked with some programming languages like JavaScript, R and Python. Currently I have focused my work on the Python environment and its libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scipy, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Keras etc.

Besides programming, I like to read, watch movies & series and go out at night ðŸŒƒ.
